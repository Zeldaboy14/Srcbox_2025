ARGG is used by Half-Life 2: Sandbox to implement rotational functionality for the physics manipulator.

It has been ported to Srcbox, as it's close to GMOD's own physgun

**Half-Life 2: Sandbox**  
https://github.com/Planimeter/hl2sb-src

Some code for Srcbox (lua, physgun implantetion) have been ported and updated for the modern SDK, from the most recent branch, and the original 2007 code.

**LUX Shaders**  
By Shiro (WhiteRedDragons)
https://github.com/LUX-Shaders-Team

Rewritten Shaders with features up-to L4D2/Portal 2/CSGO/.

It is important for sandbox enviroment, as later game maps use newer params not found in the SDK 2013.

**Notice! LUX Shaders IS NOT included at the current moment! It will be included with this project once its open-sourced**

List of things used so far:

https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013 - Alien Swarm/L4D/2 func_precipitation port (effect.cpp and other necessary things) and the main menu. Precipitation is not ported at the current moment

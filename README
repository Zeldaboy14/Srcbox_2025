ARGG is used by Half-Life 2: Sandbox to implement rotational functionality for the physics manipulator.
It has been ported to Srcbox, as it's close to GMOD's own physgun

List of things used so far:
https://web.archive.org/web/20150222194420/http://skew.telefragged.com/mods/hl2/ARGG/ - Physgun code originally used in Garry's Mod
https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Adding_PBR_to_Your_Mod - PBR tutorial
https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013 - Alien Swarm/L4D/2 func_precipitation port (effect.cpp and other necessary things) and the main menu

Special thanks:

	Shiro - Shader advice
	Ficool2 - Shader override patch
